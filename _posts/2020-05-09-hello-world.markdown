This blog is intended a place for me to share my journey further down the rabbit hole of infosec.
<br>
I would like to become more active in the community as well as have a place to collate my thoughts and notes.
<br>I hope that over time you find something useful here.<br>
If you have any comments, advice or would simply like to chat, please get in touch on twitter or via email. I'd love to hear your story.
